# exp_PRNG
This code generates random numbers that follow an exponential distribution.
This code generates pseudo random numbers that follow an exponential distribution using the inverse transform method. 
The uniform random numbers get generated by a pseudo uniform generator. It also includes a histogram generator for 
examining the distribution of the generated numbers. It calculates the sample mean and the sample variance of these numbers as well.
